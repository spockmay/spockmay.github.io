Next up is two nights of Scout backcountry backpacking. Current weather forecast is sunny with highs in the upper 50s and lows in the low 40s. There are few/none potable water sources on the trails.

The trail is an approx 7-10 miles long loop with some sections of bouldering/rock climbing, steep ascents, and possibly deep creek crossings. Elevation gain is approx 1000ft. Expected average speed is 2 mph.

**Update** as the trip gets closer the forecast keeps getting better! Now calling for mid/upper 60s and lows in the low 50s. Some scattered rain.
