Next up is two nights of Scout backcountry backpacking. Current weather forecast is sunny with highs in the upper 50s and lows in the low 40s. There are few/none potable water sources on the trails.

The trail is an approx 7-10 miles long loop with some sections of bouldering/rock climbing, steep ascents, and possibly deep creek crossings. Elevation gain is approx 1000ft. Expected average speed is 2 mph.

**Update** as the trip gets closer the forecast keeps getting better! Now calling for mid/upper 60s and lows in the low 50s. Some scattered rain.

# Recap

Friday night we arrived after driving a few hours to the trailhead. We walked for about a mile (in the twilight/dark) until we found a reasonably flat site to setup camp. Turned out to be a beautiful site near a river! We setup tents, threw bear-bags, and went to sleep. It soon started to rain.

On Saturday we got up and cooked breakfast in the rain/under a tarp. The boys tried to cook over homemade can stoves to minimial success. We then got on the trail heading clockwise. The first mile was pretty steep to a gorgeous (but foggy) overlook. Eventually the rain stopped, we had a very nice hike through some beautiful early spring forest. There were numerous improvised creek crossings but minimal bushwhacking. Overall the hike was 6.3 miles.

We got back to our camp site in the early evening, made dinner, chatted for a while before an early bed time. We got up early the next morning and packed quickly and hiked out.

# Notes for next time

- Make sure the hammock is relatively level. I ended up sliding down to the bottom the first night. 
- The Sawyer Squeeze was a pretty darn nice water filter. Super easy to setup and only two fills of the bag to fill up a bottle
- I was happy with my Starbucks Via Dark Roast instant coffee. I tried a few different types before the trip (to keep from taking my grinder) and it was the right choice.
- The MRE was terrible, don't be conned into using these ever again - even if the Troop gives them to you! The heatpad didn't work so we ended up using a JetBoil.
