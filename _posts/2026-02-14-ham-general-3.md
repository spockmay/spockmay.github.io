As seems to happen frequently, life got hectic and so I missed my goal of having my General test completed this week. However, I have managed to complete the ARRL General Class book and have full coverage of all the questions in the hamstudy app. I think I'm up to 7 or 8 reptitions of the questions, so I have pretty good confidence at this point. I know there is some channel frequency stuff from the early chapters that I'm not remembering, so I'm going to go though all the questions at least one or more times and then take some practice tests. Updated goal is to schedule the test on Monday or Tuesday of this week.

I also submitted to teach the Scouting America Radio merit badge. Should have approval of that this week. My hope is to teach some of my Scouts the MB but, more importantly, get them to pass their Technician test.
