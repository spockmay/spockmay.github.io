I have two more nights of Scout camping coming up here soon. Weather is currently looking like there will be rain most of the time we are on-site. Temps are in the mid/uppers 60s in the day, dropping down to 45F at night. Potable water is plentiful.

The theme of the trip is cooking! I'm looking forward to seeing what the girls come up with!
