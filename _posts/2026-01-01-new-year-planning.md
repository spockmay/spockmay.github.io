Happy New Year!

Hmm, well it has been a year since I've posted here. Bah. I was hoping to do better at this, but now that I have a more concrete goal hopefully that will help. Plus I've started a number of other projects this year that have kept me quite busy.

Regardless, my goal is to be working on Antartica once my kids graduate HS. Yeah, I'm probably crazy, but that place has gotten into my blood and I need to see what it is like and if I can handle it. I've done lots of difficult winter experiences in my life, so I have high confidence.

So, how to get from here to there? I've been working out a five year plan. The timining of that isn't perfect, but frankly will be close enough. So let's say my goal is to be on the ice for the summer 2031/2032 season and eventually work up to an Austral Winter (March to October) stationed at the Pole!

## The Gaps
I've reviewed a bunch of job descriptions and compared them to my resume/skills. The big gaps are all the RF experience and having the Comptia A+ paper. I certainly have the requiste computer/network skills, so I'm not overly worried about that piece. But RF, ugh. I was never good at high frequency stuff in school and can easily say that I have not done any work in the area in the interviening 20+ years.

To prove to the recruiters (and myself) that I can handle RF, I'm going to get my Ham license. And since I have the time, I'm going to be crazy and shoot for the Extra License level. I'm then going to build some kind of radio device (WSPR node maybe?).

## The Plan
The plan is broken down into five year long segments that this point. I will then expand on each point as the time comes.

### Year 1
* Get Technician and General Ham Radio License
* Get CompTIA A+ certified
* Get my dental work up to snuff

### Year 2
* Build an SDR (Software Defined Radio) using a Pi or similar Linux system.
* Get the Extra Ham Radio License

### Year 3
* Study for and pass the MD-102 (Microsoft 365 Certified: Endpoint Administrator Associate) exam
* Build a radio that can operate off of grid
* Teach Ham Radio to Scouts

### Year 4
* Get CompTIA Network+ certification (to renew/extend A+)
* Participate in Ham Radio field days to get field experience
* Customize resume for McMurdo operations

### Year 5
* Apply for positions in January!

I'll work to keep this blog updated with my status and how I am doing towards the Plan!
