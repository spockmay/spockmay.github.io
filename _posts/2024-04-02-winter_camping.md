I went camping a few weeks back and per typical Spring weather it snowed about 2" over night. According to my temp sensor it stayed around 35F inside the tent and in the morning when I went outside the sensor registered about 25F.  Pretty good!

A couple lessons learned:
 - two pairs of socks to sleep in, even if they don't really want to go on and you are tired
 - get a sleeping mat that is your size, too small lead to cold toes

Other than that, both myself and my gear did well. For my next outing I want to use my new hammock tent. I'm not sure how one would actually _use_ the thing though. Where do your boots go? Where does your pack go? At least I have a couple weeks to figure it out!
