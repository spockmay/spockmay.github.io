Hi. It feels appropriate to be writing this on April Fools Day. I had a blog back in the early 2000s that has hopefully fallen out of the memory of the Internet as things were like to do back then. I'm not really sure what my intent is here other than to play with GitHub Pages and Jeckyll. 

Since this is an "about me", I'm a electrical engineer by degree but I've done a bit of everything over the course of my career; in large part due to the fact that I've taught myself to program by playing around since I got my first RadioShack pocket computer in the late 1980s from my grandfather. It came with a book of programs that you could write into the system one line at a time on the 20ish character, single line, LCD screen. My favorite was one called Klingons where you shot the Klingons. I don't remember much else about it except that it was hundreds of lines of BASIC and took hours to enter it all. I then played with writing BASIC games on a PC similar to Mario (or Aloid) and eventually learned C and Pascal in highschool. Then it was MATLAB and PHP in college eventually transitioning to Java and Python. Now I've been playing with (finally) learning bash and looking for reasons to get into Rust.

Outside of professional stuff I love reading, camping, hiking, and building things. I'm active in volunteer opportunities in the community and try to be a good role model for my kids.
