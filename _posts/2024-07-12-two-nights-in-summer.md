I have a two night trip coming up in a couple weeks with the Scouts. While we are still a ways out, the forecast looks to have some rain on Friday and then dry and pleasantly warm the rest of the trip! Fingers crossed it stays that way. Part of the goal of the trip is to teach the kids some backpacking fundamentals. They will do a short hike upon arrival with light packs and then setup tents for the night. Since the Troop doesn't have backpacking tents, all that gear will be placed on site by car. My teaching plan at the moment is:
- throwing a bear-bag (focus on practical knots - Tenderfoot 3a-c)
- navigating (reading a map/compass - 2Class 3a)
- navigating without a compass (2Class 3d)
- using a backpacking stove (2Class 2d)
- what to pack
- briefings from recent backpackers
- Outdoor Code/Leave no Trace
- simple backpacking First Aid

Also, we have a few newer kids coming so we need to work on:
- fireman's chit
- Scout rank knots (square, two half-hitches, tautline - 4a)
- basic rope skills (whipping/fusing - Scout 4b)
- general Scout rank requirements (1, 3)
