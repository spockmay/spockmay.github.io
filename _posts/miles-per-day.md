One of the places that I have regularly strugged when planning trips is determining how many miles per day I can hike. I tend to be ridiculous and say somewhere between 12 and 20 miles per day. If it is flat(ish) then higher mileage than if in the mountains. This has honestly worked for me but when I try to plan things for Scouts I have to throw all that out of the window.

## Speed on Flat Terrain
The typical hiker in average shape will move at 2.5 mph over flat terrain. Personally, I can do 3 mph for a sustained amount of time without a pack. With a pack on I can sustain 2.5 mph over most cleared terrain within reasonable slopes. When I'm hiking with my wife I typically change my estimate to 2.2 mph as she doesn't handle slopes well.

## Naismith's Rule
In researching this article I came across [Naismith's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith%27s_rule). Naismith was a Scottish mountaineer in the late 1800s. The rule of thumb he developed is:
> Allow one hour for every 3 miles forward, plus an additional hour for every 2,000 feet (600 m) of ascent.
There's lot of other interesting stuff in the Wikipedia article (e.g. Yosemite Decimal System and tons of various corrections to Naismith's rule), but I'll focus on Naismith for now.
