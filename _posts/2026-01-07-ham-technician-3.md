So I took a few practice tests and felt pretty good, so I scheduled an online exam for today. Which just happened and I aced the test. Frankly, the hardest part was waiting for the exam to start - so I just did more practice exams. Overall, I did 9 practice exams missing only two questions. The practices were really good and had me very prepared for the actual exam.

Now I just need to wait for FCC to send me info about paying my $35 fee and then wait to get my callsign!

Kudos to [PARC](https://parcradio.org/) for running a smooth and easy remote exam session.

Next up, the General license! I was told that I shouldn't take any other tests for 30 or so days to not confuse the FCC. So that will give me plenty of time to study and prepare.
