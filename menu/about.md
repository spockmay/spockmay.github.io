This is a personal playground for me to explore GitHub Pages and Jeckyll. I started with the [Lagrange theme](https://github.com/lenpaul/lagrange) because, as a EE, how could I not! Kudos to Paul Le for writing up a brief [getting started guide](https://paulle.ca/jekyll-tutorials/deploy-jekyll-site-github-pages) as well.

Overtime I plan to delve into the theme details as well as, potentially, using this site to document some stuff I come across.
